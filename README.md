# AndroidDemoACM
To Do list app using Recycler View in android studio.

#Acomplishments
During the workshop we built out the structure of what our app will be. 
Created the item view which holds our todo items and buttons to update and delete our items.
Added the code that talks to the recycler view and sends item to it.

#Your Task
Implement the actions of the buttons.
The button listeners are ready, all you need to do is make them add a new item, delete an item and update the contents inside an item.

#Hint
Make use of the Dialog class that Android studio has!
